# PyPass
A simple Python Password Manager to allow you to securely save your usernames & passwords and interact with them. Features encryption with a 1-time key generation system.

# Instructions
  * (Required) Run `pip install cryptography` (Windows) or `pip3 install cryptography` (Linux) in your terminal
  * (Optional) If you wish to have "copy to clipboard" features then run `pip install pyperclip` (Windows) or `pip3 install pyperclip` (Linux) in your terminal
  * Open the `PyPass.py` file. Windows: Double Click. Linux: Open the terminal in the PyPass folder and run `python3 PyPass.py`
  * On first time use, a `database.json` file will be generated along with a `key.key` file. DO NOT LOSE ANY OF THOSE FILES.
  * Make sure to hide the `key.key` file somewhere secure, you will be prompted to browse for the file and open it when you open the program.

  * Causing a Keyboard Interrupt in the confirm to delete account prompt will now send you back to the select operation menu
  * Causing a Keyboard Interrupt in the select operation menu no longer throws an error, instead it will exit the program

## Build 4 - August 20, 2020
  * Added dates to new builds in the `README.MD` file
  * Added confirm password prompt when adding new account
  * Better exit handling implemented

  * Added the following libraries: `secret`, `string`, `pyperclip`
  * Decrypted passwords will automatically be copied to clipboard when searching for a specific account (This feature requires `pyperclip`)
  * When adding a new account, if the user accepted a generated password, the password will be copied to clipboard (This feature requires `pyperclip`)

## Build 6 - September 2, 2020
  * Added "Edit Account" feature that allows you to edit username, password, and notes
  * Created "Assets" directory
  * Imported 2 features from 2 libraries: `move()` from `shutil`, `urlopen()` from `urllib.request`
  * Cleaned up the code slightly
  * Database file is now stored in the Assets directory
  * If the `database.json` file is still in the main directory, it will be moved automatically

## Build 7 - February 24, 2021
  * Imported `filedialog` from `tkinter`
