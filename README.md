# PyPass
A simple Python Password Manager to allow you to save your passwords and interact with them. Features strong encryption with a 1-time key generation system.

# Instructions
* Run the "PyPass.py" file.
* On first time use, a "database.json" file will be generated along with a "key.key" file. Make sure to store this key, without it, you will be unable to access the "database.json" file (it is encrypted).
* When you want to open the program, paste the "key.key" file in the "PyPass" directory.
* The operations and actions are listed in the program.
* Once done with the program, you can use the exit operation, use a keyboard interrupt(^C), or "X" out of the program. The "database.json" will be automatically encrypted.
* Cut the "key.key" file and paste it somewhere in your machine that no one knows about.
* This cut and paste back system is done as to prevent unauthorized access. In future updates, I may add an open file dialogue.
